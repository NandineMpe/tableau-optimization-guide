## Data on the Go

Tableau isn't just for your desk. The **Tableau Mobile App** (iOS and Android) lets you keep a pulse on your business from anywhere.

### Getting Started

1.  **Download:** Get "Tableau Mobile" from the App Store or Google Play.
2.  **Server URL:** Enter `https://tableau.yourcompany.com` when asked for the server.
3.  **Login:** Use your standard company SSO credentials.

### Features for Mobile

*   **Offline Access:** Tableau Mobile automatically downloads your "Favorites" so you can view them even on a plane without WiFi.
*   **Biometrics:** Use FaceID or TouchID to log in quickly.
*   **Mobile Layouts:** Good dashboards automatically resize to fit your phone screen.

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** If a dashboard looks terrible on your phone, ask the creator to "Add a Phone Layout" in Tableau Desktop. It takes 5 minutes and makes a huge difference.
