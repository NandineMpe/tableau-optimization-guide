## Understanding Roles

In Tableau, not everyone is equal. Your ability to edit, save, or download depends on your **Site Role**.

### Common Roles

*   **Viewer:** Can view dashboards, interact with filters, and download images. Cannot edit or create new content.
*   **Explorer:** Can view and **Web Edit**. Can create new visualizations from *existing* published data sources.
*   **Creator:** Can connect to new data sources (Excel, SQL) and publish entirely new workbooks.

## Project Permissions

Content in Tableau is organized into **Projects** (like folders).
*   **Locked:** Some projects are "Locked", meaning permissions are controlled by the Project Leader.
*   **Custom:** Other projects allow the Workbook Owner to decide who sees their work.

### "Why can't I see...?"

If you get a "Resource Not Found" or "Permission Denied" error:
1.  **Check the Project:** Do you have access to the folder the report lives in?
2.  **Row Level Security:** Sometimes you can see the *dashboard*, but the *data* is blank. This usually means **Row Level Security** is active, and your username hasn't been added to the allowed list for that region/department.
