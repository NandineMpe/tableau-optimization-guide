## Start with a Question

Don't choose a chart because it looks cool. Choose it because it answers a specific question.

### 1. I want to compare values (Magnitude)
*   **Bar Chart:** The gold standard for comparison. Easy to read, clear differences.
    *   *Example:* Sales by Region, Top 10 Products.
*   **Column Chart:** Good for comparing values over time (e.g., Sales by Month) if you want to emphasize the individual months.

### 2. I want to see a trend over time (Change)
*   **Line Chart:** best for showing continuous data over time. The slope of the line clearly shows the rate of change.
    *   *Example:* Stock prices, Website traffic over a year.
*   **Area Chart:** Similar to a line chart, but emphasizes the volume.
    *   *Example:* Total inventory levels over time.

### 3. I want to see the relationship between two numbers (Correlation)
*   **Scatter Plot:** The best way to spotting outliers and trends between two variables.
    *   *Example:* Marketing Spend vs. Revenue (Is higher spend leading to higher revenue?).

### 4. I want to see parts of a whole (Composition)
*   **Stacked Bar Chart:** Good for showing how a total is broken down.
    *   *Example:* Total Sales broken down by Category.
*   **Pie Chart:** Use sparingly. Only useful if you have 2-3 categories (e.g., Yes/No/Maybe).
    *   *Avoid if:* You have more than 3 slices or if the differences are small.

### 5. I want to see distribution (Range)
*   **Histogram:** Shows how data is clustered.
    *   *Example:* Number of customers by Age Group.
*   **Box and Whisker:** Shows the median, quartiles, and outliers. Advanced but powerful.

### 6. I want to see geographical data (Location)
*   **Map:** Use only when location is the most important factor.
    *   *Example:* Sales tax by State.
    *   *Avoid if:* You just want to compare sales numbers (use a Bar Chart with State names instead—it's easier to compare lengths than color shades).

## "Show Me" Feature

If you are stuck, use Tableau's **Show Me** panel. Select the data fields you want to visualize (e.g., "Sales" and "Category"), and Tableau will highlight the recommended charts.

<Warning>
**Avoid 3D Charts:** Tableau generally avoids 3D charts for a reason—they distort the data and make it hard to read. Stick to 2D for clarity.
