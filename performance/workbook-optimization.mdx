## Why is my Dashboard Slow?

Performance is usually impacted by one of three things:
1.  **Data Volume:** Too much data being queried.
2.  **Complexity:** Too many calculations or marks on the screen.
3.  **Layout:** Too many individual sheets or filters on a single dashboard.

### 1. Data Source Best Practices

*   **Use Extracts:** Live connections can be slow. Extracts (hyper files) remain the fastest way to query data.
*   **"Hide" Unused Fields:** Before publishing, hide fields you aren't using. This reduces the extract size.
*   **Filter Early:** Use Data Source Filters to restrict data *before* it hits your dashboard.
*   **Materialize Calculations:** When creating an extract, choose to "Compute Calculations Now" so they are pre-calculated.
*   **Avoid Custom SQL:** It forces Tableau to wrap queries in a sub-select, which kills performance. Use Relationships (the "Noodle") instead.

### 2. Visualization Best Practices

*   **Limit your "Marks":** Every bar, dot, and map point is a "mark" the browser has to render.
    *   *Bad:* A scatter plot with 500,000 points.
    *   *Good:* A density map or a heatmap that aggregates those points.
*   **Avoid "Only Relevant Values" Filters:** This forces Tableau to run a query just to populate the filter dropdown. Use "All Values in Database" for faster UI.
*   **Simplify Tooltips:** Complex visualizations inside tooltips (Viz-in-Tooltip) generate extra queries on hover.

### 3. Calculations to Avoid

*   **Count Distinct (COUNTD):** This is one of the slowest operations. Use `COUNT()` if you don't need unique values.
*   **String Manipulation:** Calculations like `LEFT()`, `RIGHT()`, or `REGEXP()` are slower than simple boolean or numeric math.
*   **Nested LODs:** Level of Detail expressions are powerful but heavy. Don't nest them 3 levels deep if you can avoid it.

### 4. Running the Performance Recorder

If you can't find the bottleneck, let Tableau tell you.

1.  In Desktop, go to **Help** > **Settings and Performance** > **Start Performance Recording**.
2.  Interact with your dashboard (change filters, load sheets).
3.  Go back to **Help**... and **Stop Performance Recording**.
4.  Tableau will generate a new workbook showing exactly how long each query and rendering step took.
