## The Power of Interaction

Static reports are for printers. Tableau dashboards are designed to be **interactive**. By using filters, highlighters, and dashboard actions, you can answer specific questions without asking an analyst for a new report.

### Filters

Filters allow you to narrow down the data to what matters to you.

*   **Dropdowns:** Select one or multiple items (e.g., Region, Category).
*   **Sliders:** Adjust date ranges or numerical values (e.g., Profit > $1000).
*   **Wildcard Search:** Type to find specific customer names or IDs.

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** If you constantly mess up your filters, look for a "Reset" button on the dashboard, or use the **Revert** button in the toolbar to go back to the original state.

### Dashboard Actions

Often, the visuals themselves act as filters. This is called a "Filter Action".

1.  **Click to Filter:** Click on a bar, a map region, or a pie slice.
2.  **Watch it Update:** Other charts on the dashboard will often update to show details for *only* what you selected.
3.  **Click to Clear:** Click the same item again (or click in the whitespace) to clear the selection and see all data.

### Tooltips

Hover over any data point ("Mark") to see a **Tooltip**. 

Tooltips often contain:
*   Exact numbers that might not be visible on the axis.
*   Additional context or descriptions.
*   Sometimes, even a "Viz-in-Tooltip" (a mini chart inside the popup).

### Highlighters

Use the **Highlighter** (if available) to color a specific item across the entire dashboard while keeping the context of the other data visible. This is great for tracking a single product's performance against the crowd.
