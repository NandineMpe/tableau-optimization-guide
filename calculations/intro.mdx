## When to use a Calculation

Sometimes the data you have isn't the data you need. 
*   You have `Sales` and `Profit`, but you need `Profit Ratio`.
*   You have `First Name` and `Last Name`, but you need `Full Name`.
*   You have `Order Date`, but you need just the `Year`.

**Calculated Fields** allow you to create this new data using formulas, similar to Excel.

## Creating Your First Calculation

1.  **Right-click** anywhere in the Data Pane (left sidebar).
2.  Select **Create Calculated Field**.
3.  **Name it:** Give it a clear name (e.g., "Profit Margin").
4.  **Type the formula:** 
    ```sql
    SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Sales])
    ```
5.  **Check for Errors:** Look for the message "The calculation is valid" at the bottom.
6.  **Click OK.**

## Types of Calculations

### 1. Row-Level Calculations
These happen for *every single row* in your data.
*   *Example:* `[Sales] * 0.1` (Calculate 10% tax for every transaction).

### 2. Aggregate Calculations
These happen *after* grouping the data.
*   *Example:* `SUM([Sales])` (Total sales for the Region/Department/Year you are looking at).

<Tip>
  **Golden Rule:** You cannot mix aggregated and non-aggregated fields. 
  *   *Bad:* `SUM([Sales]) / [Profit]`
  *   *Good:* `SUM([Sales]) / SUM([Profit])`
</Tip>
