## The Old Way: Joins

In the past (and in SQL), we used **Joins** (Left, Right, Inner) to combine data.
*   **Problem:** If you joined "Sales" (many rows) with "Targets" (one row per month), you often got **duplicated data**. Your Sales numbers would explode because every sale was multiplied by the target row.
*   **Result:** You had to write complex `LOD` calculations just to get the correct sum.

## The New Way: Relationships (The Noodle)

Tableau now uses **Relationships** (represented by a flexible line or "noodle" between tables).

### Why Relationships are Better

1.  **Smart Aggregation:** Tableau checks the "Context" of your analysis.
    *   If you look at *Sales*, it queries the Sales table.
    *   If you look at *Targets*, it queries the Target table.
    *   If you look at *Sales vs Targets*, it aggregates them separately *before* combining them.
2.  **No Data Duplication:** You never have to worry about "exploding joins" again.
3.  **Performance:** It only queries the tables you are actually using in the view.

### How to Use Relationships

1.  Drag your first table (e.g., `Orders`) to the canvas.
2.  Drag your second table (e.g., `People`) *next* to it.
3.  **Drop it when you see the Noodle:** Do not double-click the first box to "open" it (that is for physical joins). Just drop it to the right.
4.  **Define the Key:** Tell Tableau which fields match (e.g., `Region` = `Region`).

<Tip>
  **Rule of Thumb:** Always start with Relationships. Only use physical Joins if you specifically need to filter out unmatched rows at the row level (e.g., Row Level Security).
