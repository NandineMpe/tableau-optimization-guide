## The Problem with Excel Files

Excel is designed for humans, not computers. We often add:
*   Titles and subtitles in the first few rows.
*   Merged cells to group columns.
*   Empty rows for spacing.
*   Footnotes at the bottom.

If you connect Tableau directly to a sheet like this, it will likely read the Title as a column header and give you `Null` values everywhere.

## The Solution: Data Interpreter

Tableau has a built-in AI tool called **Data Interpreter** that detects these common issues and resolves them automatically.

### How to Use It

1.  **Connect to Data:** Open Tableau and select **Microsoft Excel**.
2.  **Drag your Sheet:** Drag the sheet onto the canvas.
3.  **Look Left:** On the left-hand sidebar, you will see a checkbox: **"Use Data Interpreter"**.
4.  **Check It:** Click the box to turn it on.

### What Happens?

Tableau will scan the file and:
1.  Strip out the titles and footnotes.
2.  Un-merge cells and fill down the values (e.g., if "Q1" was merged across 3 months, it will put "Q1" for Jan, Feb, and Mar).
3.  Identify the true header row.

### Verifying the Results

Click the link **"Review the results"** that appears after you check the box. 
This opens an Excel file where Tableau color-codes exactly what it did:
*   **Red:** The data headers it found.
*   **Green:** The actual data it kept.
*   **Excluded:** The titles/footnotes it ignored.
