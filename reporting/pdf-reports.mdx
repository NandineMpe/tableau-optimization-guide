## When to use PDFs

Use PDFs when you need a "frozen" artifact of the data at a specific point in time, such as:
*   **Month-End Financial Statements**
*   **Regulatory Compliance Reports**
*   **Printed Handouts**

## Creating a Clean PDF

1.  **Set the Page Layout:** (If you are an Editor) Ensure the dashboard size is set to **Letter** or **A4** (not "Automatic"). This ensures the PDF doesn't cut off your charts.
2.  **Download:** Click **Download** > **PDF**.
3.  **Layout Settings:**
    *   **Scaling:** Choose "Automatic" (fit to page) or "100%".
    *   **Orientation:** Most dashboards look better in **Landscape**.
    *   **Content:** Choose "This View" for a single page or "Sheets in Workbook" for a multi-page report.

<Warning>
  **Scrollbars:** If your dashboard has a scrollbar (because there are too many rows), the PDF *will not* scroll. It will only show what is visible on the screen. **Always filter your data** so it fits on one page before printing.
</Warning>
