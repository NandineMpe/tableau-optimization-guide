## What is a Story?

A **Story** is a sequence of visualizations that work together to convey information. It works exactly like PowerPoint, but it's **interactive**.

### Why use Story Points?
*   **Live Data:** If someone asks "What about last month?", you can change the filter right there during the presentation.
*   **Narrative Flow:** You can guide the audience through your analysis step-by-step.

### How to Build a Story (For Explorers/Creators)

1.  **New Story:** Click the **New Story** tab (book icon) at the bottom left.
2.  **Drag Sheets:** Drag your dashboards or worksheets onto the canvas.
3.  **Add Context:** Click the gray box at the top to add a caption (e.g., "Sales plummeted in Q3...").
4.  **New Point:** Click **Blank** to add a new "slide".
5.  **Change State:** You can use the *same dashboard* on two different story points with *different filters*.
    *   *Point 1:* "Here is the Global view." (Map shows World)
    *   *Point 2:* "But look at Europe." (Map filtered to Europe).

<Note>
  **Best Practice:** Keep text captions short. Let the data do the talking.
