## The "Executive Summary" Workflow

While we encourage live demos, we know that sometimes you need static slides for a Board Meeting.

### The "Export as PowerPoint" Feature

Stop taking screenshots! Screenshots are blurry and hard to resize. Tableau has a native PowerPoint exporter.

1.  **Open the View:** Navigate to the specific dashboard or request you want to share.
2.  **Adjust Filters:** Set the filters to exactly what you want to show (e.g., "North America Q3 Results").
3.  **Download:** Click the **Download** button in the toolbar.
4.  **Select PowerPoint:** Choose **PowerPoint** from the list.

### Options
*   **This View:** Creates a single slide with the current dashboard.
*   **Specific Sheets:** Allows you to pick multiple sheets from the workbook and put each one on its own slide.

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** The exported image is a high-resolution static image. You can resize it on your slide without it getting pixelated. It also includes a link back to the live dashboard in the notes section!
